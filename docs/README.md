# docs/

Two kinds of documents live here:

- **Top-level `.md` files** — reference docs that describe how the project works
  right now (architecture, decisions, how-tos). These get edited in place as
  things change; they describe the _current_ state, not history.
- **`logs/`** — a dated, append-only log of work sessions. Each entry is a
  snapshot of what was done, why, and anything non-obvious that came up (gotchas,
  things that were confusing, decisions made in the moment). Logs are never
  edited after the fact — if something in an old log turns out to be wrong,
  correct it in a newer entry or in a top-level reference doc instead.

Naming: `logs/NNN-short-topic.md`, zero-padded, incrementing (`001-`, `002-`, …).
